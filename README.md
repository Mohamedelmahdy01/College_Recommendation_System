# College Recommendation System

This project is a machine-learning-powered web application that predicts the most suitable college for a user based on their preferences, learning styles, and career goals. It consists of a Flask-based API and a user-friendly web interface.

---

## Features
- Interactive form for collecting user preferences and skills.
- Backend prediction API that returns the recommended college.
- Handles both categorical and numerical inputs.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Required Libraries
Ensure Python is installed. Install the necessary Python libraries using:
```bash
pip install flask pandas joblib
```

### 2. Start the Flask API
Run the `app.py` file to start the backend server:
```bash
python app.py
```
The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### 3. Access the API
Test the API using Postman, cURL, or any client by sending a POST request to the `/predict` endpoint.

## Testing the API

You can test the API using **Postman** or cURL:

### Using Postman:
1. Open Postman and create a new `POST` request.
2. Set the URL to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict`.
3. Add a JSON body with the required fields.
4. Send the request and view the predicted college.

### Using cURL:
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "Math": 2,
    "Physics": 1,
    "Chemistry": 5,
    "Biology": 2,
    "Literature": 4,
    "History": 2,
    "Computer Science": 5,
    "Problem Solving": 5,
    "Hands-on Projects": "No",
    "Public Speaking": 3,
    "Work Style": "Independent",
    "Career Goal": "Engineer",
    "Hobbies": "Programming",
    "Competitions": "Yes",
    "Learning Preference": "Practical",
    "Group Discussions": 3,
    "Study Abroad": "Yes",
    "Tuition Importance": 1,
    "Study Close to Home": "No"
}'
```
